toposplit - Split big topojson files into a file for each object.

CURRENT VERSION 0.0.3

This is pretty much just a script I was writing for a very specific project, so
I don't know how fully I will flesh this out, hence the very early version
number. See CHANGES for more about each version.

USAGE

toposplit --input INPUT_FILE[--outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY | --feature FEATURE_TO_SPLIT] 

--input INPUT_FILE 		      INPUT_FILE is the json file you want to

--outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY	      OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is the directory you want

--feature FEATURE_TO_SPLIT	      This is for generating a file from only
	  			      one object This option supercedes --outdir.

NOTE: This demo requires wget

To use it, git clone this repository into some_dir

cd into the demo folder

   $ cd toposplit/demo

Run the demo script:
