README

toposplit - Split big topojson files into a file for each object.

CURRENT VERSION 0.0.4

This is pretty much just a script I was writing for a very specific project, so
I don't know how fully I will flesh this out, hence the very early version
number. See CHANGES for more about each version.

INSTALL

from repo:
npm install https://github.com/jakekara/toposplit -g

from npm
npm install toposplit -g

NPM PAGE

https://www.npmjs.com/package/toposplit

USAGE

toposplit --input INPUT_FILE[--outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY | --feature FEATURE_TO_SPLIT] 

--input INPUT_FILE 		      INPUT_FILE is the json file you want to
    				      split 

--outdir OUTPUT_DIRECTORY	      OUTPUT_DIRECTORY is the directory you want
	 			      the files to be stored in 
				      
--feature FEATURE_TO_SPLIT	      This is for generating a file from only
	  			      one object This option supercedes --outdir.

EXAMPLE

The demo dir contains demo.sh, which downloads a Census block file, splits it into
layers using mapshaper, and then uses topojson to split that into separate
files.

NOTE: This demo requires wget (brew install wget) and mapshaper (npm install -g mapshaper)

To use it, install toposplit, and then git clone this repository into some_dir

   $ git clone https://github.com/jakekara/toposplit.git

cd into the demo folder

   $ cd toposplit/demo

Run the demo script:

    $ chmod 755 demo.sh
    $ ./demo.sh

ABOUT

This is my first node program and package. I'm surprised this feature
wasn't in the topojson utilities Mike Bostock wrote or mapshaper.
